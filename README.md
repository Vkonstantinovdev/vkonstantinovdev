## 🚀 Learning Goals & Achievements

### What I’m Working On
- **Go Programming**: Currently learning Go to master backend development and build efficient systems.
- **Linux Systems**: Gaining hands-on experience with Linux, exploring system administration, and command-line tools.

### My Goals
1. **Become proficient in Go**: Master Go's core concepts and libraries, focusing on building scalable backend applications.
2. **Deepen Linux knowledge**: Enhance my understanding of Linux administration, scripting, and troubleshooting.
3. **Contribute to Open Source**: Start contributing to open-source Go projects in the near future.

### Why Go & Linux?
I chose Go because of its simplicity and efficiency for backend development. Linux, on the other hand, is essential for any developer, and I’m keen on mastering it for system administration and development environments.

## 🌱 Currently learning
- Go programming language basics and advanced concepts.
- Linux command-line tools, system administration basics.
